# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Repository for Exploratory Data Analysis course on Coursera

IMPORTANT: I was not able to use GIT locally due to IT restrictions. Therefore, I am not able to upload images the right way. My plots are found on the right-hand side under "issues"!!!. Sorry, had to be a bit creative here.

The corresponding R code for the plots can be found in the plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R files
